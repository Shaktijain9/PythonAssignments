# 8. As per the naming convention of variables in python , a varible can be a string of characters but can not start with number.
# Hence, egg is a valid name whereas 100 is not.

# 9. int(), float(), str() 

# 10. 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' will cause an error because string and int addition is not allowed in python.
# In order to resolve the issue we can convert 99 into string

# In[6]:


'I have eaten ' + str(99)+ ' burritos.'
